To my favourite human with whom I share my laughs and love:

When I wished to write something for your day, trust me I wanted to avoid all those cliche lines that lovers write. 
I wanted to write something fresh, something which was never written for anyone. But when I thought about us,
 I realised how you, just by coming into my life, have made me live those cliches.
  Now I see a flower and know why people say it's beautiful. Now I know how lovely it is to be cringe sometimes.
   Now I know, even after seeing one's lover umpteenth time, each and every time they see them for the first time.
    These were the cliche things I did not want to write but it's you my love. It's you who can make great things out of nothing.
     You're a wonderful woman and I just don't know what I have done to have you in my life.
      You're made for great things and I know that you will achieve them. I love you. Please be with me always. ðŸŽˆ
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-pink-600 font-semibold">
          and on your special day, i wish you the happiest birthday
        </p>
